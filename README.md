# Space-X-Falcon-9-Landing-Prediction
In this project, our objective is to predict the successful landing of the Falcon 9 first stage. SpaceX offers Falcon 9 rocket launches at a price of 62 million dollars, which is significantly lower than other providers charging upwards of 165 million dollars per launch. This cost reduction is primarily attributed to SpaceX's ability to reuse the first stage of the rocket. Therefore, by accurately predicting the landing outcome of the first stage, we can estimate the cost of a launch. This predictive information can be valuable for potential competitors looking to bid against SpaceX for rocket launch contracts. In this lab, the focus will be on collecting and formatting data from an API to facilitate our analysis.
